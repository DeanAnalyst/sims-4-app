# Implementation Plan

## Bug Fixes and Maintenance

- [x] **Updated app package name** (2024-12-19)

  - **Change**: Renamed app package name from `com.example.sims4_name_generator` to `com.dreamd.sims4_generator`
  - **Implementation**: Used `change_app_package_name` package to update both Android and iOS configurations
  - **Files Modified**: Android build.gradle.kts, iOS project.pbxproj, package structure
  - **Testing**: App builds successfully with new package name

- [x] **Fixed analyzer issues after favorite removal** (2024-12-19)

  - **Issue**: Dart analyzer found undefined parameters after removing favorite functionality
  - **Solution**: Removed all remaining references to favorite parameters in screen files
  - **Files Modified**: `lib/views/saved_characters_screen.dart`, `lib/views/favorites_screen.dart`, `lib/views/character_history_screen.dart`
  - **Testing**: Analyzer passes with no issues, app builds successfully

- [x] **Removed favorite functionality** (2024-12-19)

  - **Issue**: Favorite toggle was not working properly despite previous fixes
  - **Solution**: Completely removed favorite functionality from the app to simplify the user experience
  - **Changes**: Removed favorite button from character actions, removed favorites menu item, removed favorites from storage statistics
  - **Files Modified**: `lib/views/main_screen.dart`, `lib/views/components/character_card.dart`
  - **Testing**: App builds successfully and no compilation errors

- [x] **Fixed individual trait regeneration bug** (2024-12-19)

  - **Issue**: When regenerating an individual trait, the traits below it would also change
  - **Root Cause**: The `regenerateIndividualTrait` method was removing the trait and adding the new one at the end, changing the order
  - **Solution**: Modified the method to preserve the original position by finding the trait index and replacing it in place
  - **Files Modified**: `lib/providers/character_providers.dart`
  - **Tests**: All existing tests pass, confirming the fix maintains expected behavior

- [x] **Added random region and gender selection** (2024-12-19)

  - **Feature**: Added "Random" buttons to both region and gender selection cards
  - **Implementation**: Uses `dart:math` Random class to select random values from Region and Gender enums
  - **UI**: Random buttons styled with secondary color scheme and shuffle icon
  - **Layout Fix**: Changed region selection from Row to Column layout to prevent dropdown overflow
  - **Files Modified**: `lib/views/main_screen.dart`
  - **Testing**: App builds successfully and no compilation errors

- [x] **Fixed favorite toggle issue** (2024-12-19)

  - **Issue**: Favorite toggle was greyed out after creating a character
  - **Root Cause**: The `isFavorite` method in `CharacterStorageService` was checking both equality AND `isFavorite` property, but newly created characters have `isFavorite: false` by default
  - **Solution**: Simplified the logic to only check if the character exists in favorites list (equality check is sufficient since favorites are stored with `isFavorite: true`)
  - **Files Modified**: `lib/services/character_storage_service.dart`
  - **Tests**: All existing tests pass, confirming the fix maintains expected behavior

## Design Document

### Overview

The Sims 4 Name Generator is a cross-platform Flutter application that provides users with culturally diverse names and character traits for enhanced Sims 4 gameplay. The app follows Flutter's recommended MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers.

The application will store all data locally in organized JSON files to ensure offline functionality, fast loading times, and efficient parsing. The app will support 13 different cultural regions with 500 names each (250 male, 250 female) and include all official Sims 4 traits from the base game and expansion packs.

### Visual Design & Theme

#### Color Scheme: Dreamy Sunset Pastel

The app uses a carefully crafted pastel pink-purple color palette that creates a soft, magical, and welcoming atmosphere perfect for character creation:

**Primary Colors:**

- **Primary**: `#E1BEE7` (Mauve) - Main UI elements, buttons, headers
- **Secondary**: `#F2D7D5` (Misty Rose) - Secondary buttons, accents
- **Accent**: `#C8A2C8` (Light Medium Orchid) - Highlights, active states

**Background Colors:**

- **Background**: `#FEFBFE` (White Smoke) - Main app background
- **Surface**: `#F6F0F6` (Lavender Blush) - Cards, containers, elevated surfaces
- **Text**: `#2D2D2D` (Dark Charcoal) - Primary text color

#### Flutter Theme Implementation

```dart
class AppTheme {
  static ThemeData get lightTheme {
    return ThemeData(
      useMaterial3: true,
      colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
        seedColor: const Color(0xFFE1BEE7), // Primary Mauve
        brightness: Brightness.light,
        primary: const Color(0xFFE1BEE7),
        secondary: const Color(0xFFF2D7D5),
        tertiary: const Color(0xFFC8A2C8),
        background: const Color(0xFFFEFBFE),
        surface: const Color(0xFFF6F0F6),
        onPrimary: const Color(0xFF2D2D2D),
        onSecondary: const Color(0xFF2D2D2D),
        onBackground: const Color(0xFF2D2D2D),
        onSurface: const Color(0xFF2D2D2D),
      ),
      appBarTheme: const AppBarTheme(
        backgroundColor: Color(0xFFE1BEE7),
        foregroundColor: Color(0xFF2D2D2D),
        elevation: 0,
      ),
      elevatedButtonTheme: ElevatedButtonThemeData(
        style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
          backgroundColor: const Color(0xFFE1BEE7),
          foregroundColor: const Color(0xFF2D2D2D),
          shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
          ),
        ),
      ),
      cardTheme: const CardTheme(
        color: Color(0xFFF6F0F6),
        elevation: 2,
        shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(12)),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Design Principles

- **Soft & Welcoming**: Pastel colors create a non-intimidating, friendly interface
- **Magical Atmosphere**: Pink-purple tones evoke creativity and fantasy
- **High Readability**: Dark charcoal text ensures excellent contrast
- **Modern Material Design**: Follows Material 3 guidelines with custom colors

### Architecture

#### Riverpod Architecture Pattern

The application follows Flutter's recommended architecture using Riverpod for state management:

**UI Layer (Views):**

- **Views**: Flutter ConsumerWidgets that compose the user interface
- **Providers**: Manage UI state and handle user interactions using Riverpod
- Reactive UI updates through ref.watch() and ref.listen()

**Data Layer:**

- **Repositories**: Source of truth for application data, exposed as Providers
- **Services**: Handle data loading from local JSON files using rootBundle.loadString()
- **Models**: Domain models representing names, traits, and character profiles

**Provider Layer:**

- **StateProviders**: Simple state management for UI preferences
- **FutureProviders**: Asynchronous data loading operations
- **StateNotifierProviders**: Complex state management with business logic

#### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Providers manage all data access and state
3. **Reactive Programming**: Automatic UI updates when provider state changes
4. **Dependency Injection**: Providers automatically handle dependency injection
5. **Offline-First**: All data stored locally for offline functionality
6. **Testability**: Providers can be easily mocked and tested in isolation

### Components and Interfaces

## Developer Guide

### Overview

This guide is for developers who want to contribute to or extend the Sims 4 Name & Trait Generator application. The app is built with Flutter using the MVVM architecture pattern and Riverpod for state management.

### Development Setup

**Prerequisites**:

- Flutter SDK: 3.10.0 or higher
- Dart SDK: 3.0.0 or higher
- IDE: Android Studio, VS Code, or IntelliJ IDEA
- Git: For version control

**Environment Setup**:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
3. Run the app: `flutter run`
4. Run tests: `flutter test`

**Code Generation**:

```bash
# Generate mock classes
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

### Architecture Overview

**MVVM Pattern**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture with clear separation between data models, services, repositories, and state management.

**State Management with Riverpod**: Riverpod provides reactive state management with dependency injection:

```dart
// Provider definition
final characterGeneratorProvider = StateNotifierProvider<CharacterGeneratorNotifier, CharacterGeneratorState>((ref) {
  final nameRepository = ref.watch(nameRepositoryProvider);
  final traitRepository = ref.watch(traitRepositoryProvider);
  return CharacterGeneratorNotifier(nameRepository, traitRepository);
});

// Usage in widgets
class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final state = ref.watch(characterGeneratorProvider);
    final notifier = ref.read(characterGeneratorProvider.notifier);

    return // widget implementation
  }
}
```
